    <textOnly>Dear member of “DuPont™ Corian® Quality Network”,

The DuPont™ Corian® business has adopted a new computer-based system software which will be used to store in a standard, consistent way all the documents as electronic files.

We take the opportunity of this change to send you the new version of the “DuPont™ Corian® Quality Network” contract.

This new version includes some changes requested by DuPont Legal Affairs (elimination of some anomalities and insertion of more precise and updated guidelines for the usage of our trademark and logo and of our intellectual assets, aiming at better protecting them from unvoluntary misuses and from unvoluntary uses conflicting with DuPont legal and international legal requirements).

We kindly ask you to:
- print two copies of the new “DuPont™ Corian® Quality Network” contract
- paragraph each page of the contracts
- stamp and sign the last page
- then send them both back to the following address:

DuPont de Nemours (Belgium) BVBA
Attn {!Qualification__c.Owner__c}
Department CORIAN®
Building Innovations - KGB4
Antoon Spinoystraat 6
2800 Mechelen
Belgium

The agreements will be scanned and filed electronically, a legalized copy will be sent to you.

Your company can have a new “DuPont™ Corian® Quality Network” membership certificate by contacting us.

In case of questions, do not hesitate to contact us.

Friendly Regards,

{!Qualification__c.Owner__c}
