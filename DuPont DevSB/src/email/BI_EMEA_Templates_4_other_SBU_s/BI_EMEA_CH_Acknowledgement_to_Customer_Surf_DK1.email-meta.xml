    <textOnly>Dear customer,

Thank you for registering your complaint. Your complaint reference is: {!Case.CaseNumber}.  We’ll do our utmost to have your complaint solved in the shortest time possible.

Upon completion of your file, we will contact our service center or QN fabricator to settle a date for an expertise/intervention.

Our service center/QN fabricator will inspect the damage and if possible repair immediately.

May we remind you to free up space and keep Corian® rest material available to avoid colour mismatch. Be aware that the intervention might cause inconvenience. 

If your request falls under the 10 Year Limited Installed Warranty, the cost of the intervention will be accepted. In case the damages fall outside warranty, the service center/QN fabricator will make you an offer for repair or refreshment.

Upon completion, the service center/QN fabricator will ask you to sign a satisfaction form which serves as the basis for his payment. 

Should you have any questions or remarks, do not hesitate to contact us.

Friendly Regards,
