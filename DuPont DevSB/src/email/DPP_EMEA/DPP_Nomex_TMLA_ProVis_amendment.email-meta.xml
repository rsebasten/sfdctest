    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name}
 
As you know, during the last A+A edition in Dusseldorf we launched Nomex® ProVis, the new high-visibility offering specifically designed for Industrial markets. Some of our weavers have already produced the fabric and it will soon be available for you to start producing and certifying garments. 
 
Please note that in order for you to be able to use the Nomex® ProVis Trademark we have amended Exhibit A, Exhibit B and Exhbit C of the DuPont(TM) Nomex® Trademark Licence Agreement that you had previously signed with us. Please note as well, in Exhibit B, the requirements for labels on Nomex(r) ProVis garments. 
 
The amended Exhibits are attached to this e-mail. Please print out 2 copies and sign them. The completed and signed original documents can then be sent by post to our Geneva office, as per below address details:
