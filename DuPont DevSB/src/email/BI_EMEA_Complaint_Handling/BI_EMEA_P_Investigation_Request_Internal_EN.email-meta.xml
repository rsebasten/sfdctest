May I kindly request to send me your feedback within 3 working days and to notify me if this defect needs further investigation at the plant. In the latter case a path forward would be appreciated.

Meanwhile a solution has been found for the customer but the complaint will not be closed internally until your feedback has been received by replying to this notification.

Please refer in all communication to the above Case ID number and ensure your replies are sent to Lizy Van Roy.

Thank you for your cooperation.
