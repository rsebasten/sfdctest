    <textOnly>Dear customer,
Thank you for registering your complaint. We’ll do our utmost to have yourcomplaint solved in the shortest time possible.


Upon completion of your file, we will contact our service centre or IndustrialPartner to settle a date for an inspection / repair.


Our service centre / Industrial Partner will inspect the damage and if possible repair immediately.   May we remind you to free up space and keep Corian® Solid Surface rest material available to avoid colour mismatch. Be aware that the intervention might cause inconveniences.

Upon completion, the service centre / Industrial Partner will ask you tosign a satisfaction form which serves as the confirmation for his services.
