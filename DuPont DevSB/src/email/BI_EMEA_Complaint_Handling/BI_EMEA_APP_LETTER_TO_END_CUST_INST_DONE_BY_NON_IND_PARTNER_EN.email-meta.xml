    <subject>Corian® Solid Surface: Info about Case {!Case.CaseNumber}.</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Sir, Madam,


After checking our records we found out that the fabricator of your installation in

Corian® Solid Surface dated from {!Case.Installation_Date__c}, does not belong to our

Quality Network of authorized fabricators unfortunately.



The Corian® Solid Surface ten (10) Year Limited Installed Warranty applies exclusively to

interior decorative Corian® Solid Surface installations that are installed and fabricated by

Corian® Solid Surface Quality Network Installers/Fabricators and in accordance with

the installation procedure in force at the time of installation.


Therefore this warranty cannot be granted and does not cover the costs involved.
However, we have a network of Corian® Solid Surface Quality Network fabricators,

which have the necessary know-how to carry out repairs or maintenance works for you.

If you are interested, please contact us so we can inform you about the service centre

and/or Industrial Partner which is nearest to you.


For any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.


Kind regards,


{!Case.OwnerFullName}

QN &amp; Warranty Assistant
