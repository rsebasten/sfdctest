3. If the source revealed is a DuPont customer, we’ll request proper revisions needed of our DuPont trademarks as applicable.


We would expect the above steps to be taken within the next fourteen (14) days.  Changes to printed materials such as catalogs, brochures, may be made at the next printing.
