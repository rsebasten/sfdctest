    <subject>{!Case.CaseNumber}: Proper Use - Notice of Trademark Infringement {!Case.Customer_Lab_Result__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Company__c}:


This is in reference to the ____________ article entitled “_______________” in the _______________ section of your edition of _________________.


We appreciate the favorable mention of our company in your article and drawing your readers’ attention to the fact that the {!Case.Product_Selected__c} is a product made by DuPont.  DuPont has invested  a substantial amount of effort and financial resources in advertising and promoting its trademarks in order to establish them as a symbol of our company’s high quality products.  We are sure you will agree with us that trademarks are valuable properties deserving protection.


As a reminder and in our endeavor to diligently protect our intellectual property, we would like to emphasize the proper use of our trademarks when cited in published articles.


At least once in any article that makes mention of a DuPont trademark, the word DuPont™ (with the ™ superscript) should precede the product trademark that in turn should carry a trademark superscript ™ or registered trademark superscript ® depending upon the specific trademark.  In addition, a footnote should be included indicating the relevant portion of our descriptor, “The DuPont Oval Logo, DuPont™, The miracles of science™ and all products denoted with a ™ and ® are trademarks or registered trademarks of DuPont or its affiliates.”


In the case of the subject article, mention of DuPont™ {!Case.Product_Selected__c} along with the footnote “{!Case.Product_Selected__c} are registered trademarks of DuPont or its affiliates” would have been the proper manner in which to describe these trademarks. By the way, the use of DuPont (without the ™) is correct for describing the company when not directly associating it with a trademark.


We trust this information will be helpful, and we encourage and would appreciate your publication complying with these guidelines in all future articles that make mention of our company’s trademarks.


If you have any questions concerning the proper identification of our trademarks, please feel free to contact us at brand.protection@dupont.com or by fax at 302-380-3509.


Thank you for your assistance and cooperation in this matter.


Sincerely,


DuPont Brand Protection Center


DuPont™ and {!Case.Product_Selected__c} are trademarks or registered trademarks of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company.</textOnly>
