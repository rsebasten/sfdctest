Re:  Unauthorized Use of the DuPontTM Trademark by


Dear Mr. {!Case_Company__c.Name},


Please be advised that this is a follow-up to the correspondence we sent you dated {!SVMXC__Case_Line__c.LastActivityDate} stating the unauthorized use of the DuPontTM Trademark on your website{!Case.Site_Address__c} . As of this date, we have not heard from you.


After further research, we are still finding occurrences of the DuPontTM trademark on your website and product literature (see enclosed). Please have your webmaster correct this immediately. If this is a manufacturer or distributor or webmaster oversight, please make sure this final notification is taken care of now by your company since direct infringement liability now falls in your company for such unauthorized use of the DuPontTM trademark. Meanwhile all use of the DuPontTM trademark must cease now to avoid any legal actions against your company.


If we cannot settle this matter amicably within the term indicated below, and we do not receive your written compliance to cease all use of the DuPontTM trademark we will forward this matter for immediate litigation prosecution with our appointed counsel copied herein. We look forward to your compliance and look forward to hearing from you within two (2) business days of receipt of this legal final infringement letter.


Sincerely,



Giselle Ruiz-Arthur

Sr. Trademark Counsel
