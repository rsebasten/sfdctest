    <subject>Welcome to the Portal of the Quality Network of DuPont CORIAN® !</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear partner,


We are implementing a series of programs and actions related to the « Endless Evolution » initiative as a means to reinforce your competitiveness and reinforce the value of our product.


Today we are launching a portal designed for our Corian® Quality Network Members.


The portal is meant to share technical information which is updated on DuPont™ Corian®.


You will receive in the next days your user name and an activation link with your password as well as more detailed user instructions.

A link will be put on the internet site www.corian.co.uk in the part of the Corian® Quality Network, which you can access by means of your user name and password.


The portal is available 24h/24 and 7d/7 and is accessible wherever there is an internet connection.


Your access is unique and confidential and can’t be shared.



Regards,

XYZ</textOnly>
