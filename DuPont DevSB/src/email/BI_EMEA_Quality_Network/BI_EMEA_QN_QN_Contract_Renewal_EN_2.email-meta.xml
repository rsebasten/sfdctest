    <textOnly>Dear customer,




Within the &quot;Endless Evolution&quot; initiative that has been announced a few days ago, we are dedicating major attention to the upgrade of the “Corian® Solid Surface Quality Network” program.

This upgrade involves also the creation of a new Quality Network contract, better reflecting the market needs and including also changes requested by the legal department of DuPont.

We would appreciate if you could:

- print two copies of the new “Corian® Solid Surface Quality Network” contract

- paragraph each page of the contracts

- stamp and sign the last page

- then send them both back to the following address:

Att: DuPont de Nemours (Belgium) BVBA
Department Corian® Solid Surface
Safety &amp; Construction - KGB4, Antoon Spinoystraat 6, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium

The Quality Network agreement will be scanned and filed electronically, a legalized copy will be sent to you.

After having sent us the new agreement, you can request us:

- a new “Corian® Solid Surface Quality Network” membership certificate;

- the new “Corian® Solid Surface Quality Network” logo that you should use to represent your status of Quality Network member.

In case of questions, do not hesitate to contact us.

As far as it concerns the &quot;Corian® Solid Surface Quality Network&quot; agreement  between our companies, Nr. {!Qualification__c.Reference_Id__c} dated {!Qualification__c.Last_Contract_Date__c}, as required by law, we have to declare that we hereby terminate it by giving you thirty (30) days written notice from the date of receipt of this letter, in accordance with what is stated in the contract itself.


We look forward to beginning a new journey with you into the evolution of Corian® Solid Surface and have you among the valuable members of the renewed &quot;Quality Network&quot;.


Best Regards,</textOnly>
