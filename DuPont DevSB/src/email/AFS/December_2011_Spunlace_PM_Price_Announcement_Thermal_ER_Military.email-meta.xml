Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName} :

Effective January 15, 2016, the North America Kevlar® fiber prices for Industrial end use applications will increase by 4.5%. (Please remember that all orders are priced at time of shipment not when they are placed.)

These increases will help support continued investment in productivity, material science, product development and our brands to help meet the needs and expectations of our customers and those who use these products in their daily lives.

Please be assured that DuPont Protection Technologies values our relationship with you and appreciates your continued use of DuPont products in the solutions you provide to help protect people.

Please confirm the receipt of this message and also let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,


Beth L Taylor
