    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Salutation} {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName},

Thank you for your interest in IACP/DuPont Kevlar® Survivors&apos; Club®.


The International Association of Chiefs of Police and DuPont started the IACP/DuPont Kevlar Survivors&apos; Club® in 1987. Since then, over 3,000 individuals working in law enforcement have survived both ballistic and non-ballistic incidents because they were wearing body armor. The IACP/DuPont Kevlar Survivors&apos; Club® consists of officers who have survived potentially fatal and/or disabling injuries through the use of body armor, and pays tribute to those who have the foresight to “Dress for Survival.&quot; The Survivors’ Club goals are:

To reduce death and disability by encouraging increased wearing of body armor.
To recognize and honor those deserving individuals who, as a result of wearing body armor, have survived life/disability-threatening incidents.
To serve the law enforcement community by collecting important data and sharing valuable information relating to those survivor incidents with other fellow officers.
