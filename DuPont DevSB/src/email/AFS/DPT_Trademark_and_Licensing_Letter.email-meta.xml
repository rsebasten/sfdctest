    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}{!Lead.LastName},

Thank you for your interest in DuPont™ Kevlar® or Nomex® brand products.

The use of the Kevlar® or Nomex® brands in a promotional way or advertising is not permitted without a Trademark Licensing Agreement (TMLA) from DuPont.  A TMLA may be a royalty bearing contract that allows the licensee to market his/her products in association with the Kevlar® brand under certain terms and conditions such as use of the brand on labels, packaging and hang-tags in a promotional manner.  Such promotional use of the Kevlar® brand is therefore restricted to only those companies who are licensed accordingly.

By law the statutory &apos;fair use&quot; principle for trademarks is the good faith use of the KEVLAR® and NOMEX® brands to describe the goods made with KEVLAR® and/or NOMEX® fiber or to describe their geographic origin (who made them) without prominent words, context, format and multiple references that would normally occur in a promotional advertising.

An example would be to include in the ingredient section or in reduced font in front label with other ingredients mentioned to include&quot;This product contains Kevlar® brand fiber and cotton&quot; or &quot;This product is made with Kevlar® brand fibers and ____&quot;, with a footnote indicating that Kevlar® as a registered trademark of DuPont.

If you are interested in pursuing a Trademark Licensing Agreement (TMLA) from DuPont, please complete and return the attached document to JOANN.B.HENNESSY@dupont.com .
