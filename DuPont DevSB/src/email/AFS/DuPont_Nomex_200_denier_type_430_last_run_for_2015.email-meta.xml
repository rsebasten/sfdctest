    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName} :


I know the year is winding down for 2015, but I wanted to provide a production update on Nomex® 200 denier.

We will be manufacturing 1 more run of the DuPont™ Nomex® 200 denier type 430, merge 1X007 for 2015 around the first of December.  (Product will be available to ship the following week.)
I have heard that since we are trying to keep inventory lean, we are not making a lot of extra inventory.  Next production after that will probably be mid-January 2016 (shipping end of January.).

If you think you will need any product between now and end of January, please place your order by the November 30th to Customer Care Center (DPTAramidsDom@dupont.com) and copy me.

I hope this information is helpful.  Let me know if you have any questions and have a great weekend.
