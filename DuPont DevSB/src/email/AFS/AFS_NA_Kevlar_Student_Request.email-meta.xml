    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}{!Lead.LastName},

Thank you for your inquiry about DuPont™ Kevlar® and Nomex®.


Kevlar® has an advanced technology from DuPont™ that helps transform the ordinary to the extraordinary. DuPont™ Kevlar® is five times stronger than steel on an equal weight basis and combines high strength with lightweight, and comfort with protection to deliver the highest levels of performance. It is this balance of unusual properties which is responsible for the broad range of Kevlar® applications from ballistic vests to cut-resistant gloves to new markets, such as tornado and blast-resistant structures.  Please check out our website for further technical information. You will find there our technical guide on Kevlar® and other kind of technical literature on Kevlar® products.
