Dear Customer,
 
DuPont Protection Technologies will be implementing price increases beginning December 1, 2010.  Prices will be increased on Nomex® and Kevlar® products on average by 5%.
 
DuPont continues to invest in research and development and manufacturing capacity to meet the growing demand for Nomex® and Kevlar® products across a wide range of applications. These manufacturing investments include implementing new production systems that will further improve the productivity of our current assets as well as projects that will significantly increase Nomex® and Kevlar® capacity over the next five years.
 
The new prices will apply to all shipments on or after the effective price increase date.  Based on historical order quantities, DuPont may reserve the right to place limits on orders placed prior to the price increase.
 
DuPont Protection Technologies values our relationship with you and appreciates your continued use of our products. 
 
The information contained in this letter is DuPont Confidential Information.  If you have additional questions please contact your DPT Sales Account Manager.  Thank you for your business and your continued support of DuPont.
