RFP Label Removal from Kevlar® Pulp Products

Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Based on evaluation of all relevant data for classification of para-aramid respirable fibers for specific target organ toxicity – repeated exposure (STOT-RE), a hazard classification is not warranted. We will discontinue labelling pulp products with these warnings. However, good engineering practices and ventilation should continue to be used to minimize exposure.

During label phase out, you may still receive some packaging that continue to be labelled. We would like to emphasize that, notwithstanding the label modifications mentioned herein, our products have not changed.

We remain at your disposal for any further information you may require going forward.

Sincerely,

Dilys M. Henry PHD. CEng.
