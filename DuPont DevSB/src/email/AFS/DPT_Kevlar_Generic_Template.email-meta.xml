    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName},

Thank you for your inquiry about DuPont™ Kevlar®, an advanced technology from DuPont™ that helps transform the ordinary to the extraordinary. DuPont™ Kevlar® is five times stronger than steel on an equal weight basis and combines high strength with lightweight, and comfort with protection to deliver the highest levels of performance. It is this balance of unusual properties which is responsible for the broad range of Kevlar® applications from ballistic vests to cut-resistant gloves, automotive tires, belts and hoses to new markets, such as tornado and blast-resistant structures and reinforcement for fiber optic cables and off shore drilling lines.

Please check out our website www.kevlar.com for further technical information. We hope that this will be of help to you.
