May, 2012


Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

A few days ago Dupont annouced that effective May 15, 2012, Kevlar® core products will be given target order lead times based on their designation as Standard or Nonstandard products.

Also effective July 1, 2012, any orders accepted for Kevlar® yarn configurations that are not Primary or Secondary will incur an additional $500 fee.  Note, only Primary package configurations will be available for Kevlar® pulp and staple.

The following table illustrates the products your company purchases and target order lead times in weeks:

Our goal is to improve the lead times experienced for Standard products in Primary configurations and also provide more consistent and predictable delivery timing for Nonstandard and Secondary configuration offerings.

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Sincerely,
Beth L Taylor
